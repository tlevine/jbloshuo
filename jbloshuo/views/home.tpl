<h1>Jobs</h1>
<p>
  Do you want someone to do some work for you? Maybe Tom can do it.
  Or maybe he knows someone else who can. Fill out the appropriate
  form, and Tom will get back to you.
</p>
<p>
  Do you want to hire a consultant (short-term or maybe part-time)
  or an employee?
</p>
<ul class="job-type">
  <li><a href="consultant">Consultant</a></li>
  <li><a href="employee">Employee</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
  If neither of these categories seems quite right,
  choose whichever seems closest, or just explain your situation in
  an <a href="mailto:_@thomaslevine.com">email</a> instead.
